# 🎨 Neural Style Transfer with Gradio

This project allows users to apply the artistic style of one image to another using TensorFlow and a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub, all within a Gradio interface.

## 🚀 Demo
**Live App**: [https://a4fd41d86b43472518.gradio.live](https://a4fd41d86b43472518.gradio.live) #available till 7 days 
**Demo Video**: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mukesh-moharana-245748276_builtwithai-aistyletransfer-nocode-activity-7321220530135621632-eVlS?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAENir1UBbvbZFA1hfpupfhCrv5rfPyDsHBY]

## 🛠️ Built With
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub (Magenta Style Transfer)
- Gradio
- PIL
- NumPy
- Google Colab

## 🔧 Prompt Used
> "Build a Gradio app in Google Colab that performs neural style transfer using the Magenta model from TensorFlow Hub. Let the user upload a content image and a style image, and see the stylized output image."

## 🧪 How It Works
Users upload two images:
- A **content image**
- A **style image**

The model blends the two to generate a new image styled like the second image, but preserving the content of the first.

## 📁 File Structure
- `neural_style_transfer.ipynb`: The main Colab notebook

✨ Built with 💡 in Google Colab. Shared via Gradio Live.
