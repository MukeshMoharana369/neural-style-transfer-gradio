Project: Create a full AI-powered Image Style Transfer tool that:
Takes two image uploads from the user: a content image (a photo) and a style image (an artwork or painting).
Uses TensorFlow or PyTorch to apply Neural Style Transfer (NST) and combines both images.Provides an easy-to-use interface with Gradio that allows non-technical users to upload the images, adjust parameters (e.g., style weight and content weight), and receive a stylized image.
Includes a download button to save the stylized image.
Step-by-Step Guide:
Set Up the Environment:
Use Google Colab to write and execute the code.
Install necessary libraries: tensorflow, gradio, numpy, pillow.
Enable GPU in Colab for faster processing.
Load the Pre-trained Model:
Use TensorFlow Hub to load a pre-trained model for Neural Style Transfer (e.g., magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256).
Make sure the model is appropriate for your use case (content + style transfer).
Preprocess Images:
Ensure the images are resized to a size compatible with the model (e.g., 256x256 or 512x512).
Normalize the images as required by the model.
Use Pillow to load and process the images, and NumPy for array manipulation.
Apply Style Transfer:
Using the loaded NST model, apply the style transfer to the content and style images.
Use the content weight and style weight sliders to allow users to control how much influence the content and style images have on the final output.
Build the Gradio Interface:
Create a simple Gradio interface with:
File input fields for uploading the content and style images.
Sliders for adjusting style weight and content weight.
A run button to process the images.
A display area to show the stylized image.
A download button to allow the user to download the stylized result.
Ensure Smooth User Flow:
Add appropriate tooltips to guide users on how to upload images and adjust weights.
Display progress or a loading indicator while the images are being processed.
Handle errors like wrong image format, empty image uploads, etc.
Expected Output
Stylized Image: After the user clicks the "Run" button, the processed stylized image will be displayed.
Download Option: Once the user is satisfied with the result, they should be able to download the image.
The interface should be responsive and beginner-friendly.
Code Structure:
Section 1: Import libraries (tensorflow, gradio, pillow, numpy).
Section 2: Load the pre-trained model using TensorFlow Hub.
Section 3: Define helper functions to process and apply style transfer.
Section 4: Build the Gradio interface with clear instructions for users.
Section 5: Implement error handling, display loading indicators, and provide feedback.
Section 6: Allow users to download the stylized image after processing.Example Output:
Content Image: A cityscape (e.g., "city_photo.jpg")
Style Image: A famous painting (e.g., "starry_night.jpg")
Stylized Image: A cityscape that has been transformed to look like Van Goghâ€™s "Starry Night."
Guidance for Debugging:
Check if the model is loading correctly.
Ensure that the user-uploaded images are compatible with the model (resolution and format).
Handle any exceptions that might arise during image processing or model inference.
